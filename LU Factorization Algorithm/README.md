# **LU Factorization Algorithm Description**
This algorithm determines the LU factorization of a square matrix using gauss elimination. A final LU factorization can be reached with and without using partial pivoting. In addition, if partial pivoting is used, it will track and display the permutation matrix for the user. 

## Inputs
- A **square** coefficient matrix

## Outputs
- L = the lower triangular matrix
- U = the upper triangular matrix
- P = the permutation matrix

## Limitations
In order for this algorithm to work it must be given a square matrix (a matrix with an equal number of rows and columns).
