# **LU Factorization Algorithm Description**
This algorithm determines the LU factorization of a square matrix. The algorithm is capable of factorization with and without using partial pivoting. In addition, if partial pivoting is used, it will track and display the permutation matrix for the user. 

## Inputs
- A **square** coefficient matrix

## Outputs
- L = the lower triangular matrix
- U = the upper triangular matrix
- P = the permutation matrix

## Limitations
In order for this algorithm to work it must be given a square matrix (a matrix with an equal number of rows and columns).
